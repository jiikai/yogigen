A tongue-in-cheek webapp for producing random teabag aphorisms ranging from the trite to the absurd.

Source material from which the app constructs its output consists of a hard-earned collection of authentic aphorisms from actual teabags.

I wrote this in C because 1) I am crazy 2) I wanted to learn the language.

TODO:
- write this readme
- unit tests
- pretty up the page layout
