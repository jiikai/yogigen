**YogiGen**

A tongue-in-cheek webapp for producing random teabag aphorisms ranging from the trite to the absurd.

Source material from which the app constructs its output of authentic aphorisms from actual teabags.

Uses PostgresSQL for storing the source material and generated strings (if a permalink is desired).

Still heavily in progress.

The app will be deployed to Heroku when ready.

TODO:
- fix programmatical and grammar errors in output
- complete this readme
- write unit tests
- pretty up the page layout
