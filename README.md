**YogiGen**

A tongue-in-cheek webapp for producing random teabag aphorisms ranging from the trite to the absurd.

Source material from actual teabags.

Uses PostgresSQL for storing the source material and generated strings (if a permalink is desired).

Still heavily in progress.

The app will be deployed to Heroku when ready.

TODO:
- fix grammar and style errors in output
- complete this readme
- write unit tests
- pretty up the page layout
