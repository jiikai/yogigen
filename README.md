**YogiGen**

A tongue-in-cheek webapp for producing random teabag aphorisms ranging from the trite to the absurd.

Source material from which the app constructs its output of authentic aphorisms from actual teabags.

Still heavily in progress.

TODO:
- fix programmatical and grammar errors in output
- complete this readme
- write unit tests
- pretty up the page layout
